<p>The Great Wild Goose Pagoda in modern day Xi’an was built to house the Buddhist scriptures and objects the famous monk Xuan Zang brought back from his travels along the Silk Road.  The square, pale yellow pagoda gracefully reaches into the sky far above the Ci’en temple and nearby trees, thus serving as a beacon of Buddhism for many to see.  Its central location with the monastic complex signifies its importance and the sacredness of the objects housed within the pagoda.  Originally the Great Wild Goose Pagoda had only five stories, but was rebuilt during the 8th century CE to reach seven stories with each story uniformly decreasing in size.  While the brick structure mimics the more common Chinese wooden architecture, it is stronger and more durable than wooden pagodas.  The decision to use brick can be interpreted to symbolize time, more specifically, eternity because it is long lasting.  The simple facade, symmetrical lines, large scale, and location at Ci’en Temple create a reverent, sacred environment that fosters worship and meditation.
