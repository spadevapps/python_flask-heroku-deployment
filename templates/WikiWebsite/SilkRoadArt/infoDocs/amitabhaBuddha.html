  <p>Some of the most distinctive features of the Altar to Amitabha Buddha are the ornate carvings, central Buddha figure, and stately animals located in the front of the object.  The top of the altar is crowned with an abundance of flowers, showing some sort of floral paradise above the Buddhaâ€™s head.  The Buddha himself sits atop a lotus flower pedestal, and is flanked by two attendants. The bronze medium gives crates an air of grandeur and beauty, as well as its ornate detail prompts reflection.  The elaborate carvings, bi-lateral symmetry and the prominent central figure of the Buddha come together to create a sense of reflection and awe.</p>
