<p>Upon cresting a ridge in the Swat Valley and seeing the Amluk Dara Stupa, a Buddhist merchant on the Silk Road would have been struck by its imposing posture. It rose, a mountain in and of itself. First built in the third century CE and eventually expanded to a rectangular base which measured one hundred and fifteen feet long. This base rose to give way to a great curving dome that rose just as high. The merchant would notice the near-perfect symmetry of the Stupa-- something broken by the later addition of a staircase-- and the careful carving of the massive stone blocks of granite, gneiss, and schist which created it. Next, he might notice the juxtaposition of the imposing Stupa with the arbors and gardens that the monks cultivated around it. It was as if they were trying to blend the Stupa into the landscape. All this would combine to create a space of majesty, one that was both sublime in its imposing frame but also graceful with its flora. It would create a piece of architecture with a deeply sacred atmosphere. Now, though it stood the test of time, it is little more than a recently looted ruin. However, it still provides a deeply important testament to the people and travelers-- their religion, cultures, and economic standing-- who lived in the Swat Valley before the first millennium. It speaks to a past of Buddhism and trade flourishing.
