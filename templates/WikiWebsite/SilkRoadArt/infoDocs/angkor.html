<p>Located in Siem Rep, Cambodia, Angkor Wat was built by Khmer King in 12th century. As the
largest temple complex remained in the current world, Angkor Was has been use for religious rituals
during past eight hundred years. From my perspective, there are four features making Angkor Wat a
wonderful and unique cultural, religious, and political heritage site.
First, central structure. From aerial view we can easily find out that in the center of natural forests,
Angkor Wat has a square-like construction form, surrounded by artificial rivers. Second, khmer
architecture. Built by stones, Angkor Wat combines two basic plans of Khmer temple architecture:
the temple-mountain and the later galleried temple. It is designed to represent Mount Meru, home of
the devas in Hindu mythology. At the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers. Under the
influence of Hinduism and Buddhism across the Indochina Peninsula, Angkor Wat shares common
similarity of South and Southeast Asia.
Third, building sculpture. Same as the architectural style, building sculpture in Angkor Wat was
greatly inspired by both Hinduism and Buddhism. Siting, standing, dancing figures with naked and
half-nude body reveals the meaning of purity. Using sandstone, ancient artists in Khmer Empire
made it with detailed composition and polished it smoothly. Fourth, natural environment. Due to the
rainforest climate, Angkor Wat is not merely a holy temple but a botanic garden. Trees and moss
spreads out the temple complex, which makes artificial building and natural environment become
one.
In conclusion, with rich decorations and skilled construction, Angkor Wat is the prime example of
the classical style of Khmer architecture—the Angkor Wat style—to which it has given its name. It
not only inherits cultural and arts heritage from South Asia, but also inspires religious architecture
in Myanmar and Laos, with the outspread of Khmer Empire.</p>
