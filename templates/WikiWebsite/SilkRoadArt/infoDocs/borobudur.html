<p>Borobudur was built in 800 CE in Central Java, Indonesia. The use of this structure is poorly understood, but it is suggested that it represents a 3 dimensional mandala. The size and elements of this structure are the most distinctive features. It stands 100 feet tall and is made of volcanic-stone blocks. There are 5 rectangular terraces and 3 circular terraces with 72 smaller stupas surrounding a large bell-shaped stupa in the middle. The terraces are carved with figures that depict moral lessons at the lower levels and as you travel up to the top levels, there are religious images, such as the Buddhaâ€™s past lives. One of the terraces has a scene about drunkenness and moderation where those who were not participating in drunkenness, were rewarded when they were reincarnated. The idea about this structure representing a 3 dimensional mandala is interesting considering the intricate carvings on each terrace. The circular terraces depicted with the religious images and stupas signify that the universe has no end and the heavenly realm surrounds the mortal realm on the larger, lower terraces. </p>
