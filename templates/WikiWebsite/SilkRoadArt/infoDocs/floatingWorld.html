<p>“The flowers of Beauty in the Floating World: Motoura and Yaezakura of the Minami
Yamasakiya” by Suzuki Harunobu is a polychrome woodblock print on paper. This print features
a young girl and a woman gazing upon the water. The two figures are located in the center of
the print and are clothed in robes of bright color, acting as the focal point of the art piece. The
bright colors they are adorned in contrast the muted color scheme of the background,
emphasizing importance of these two figures. The straight and repeating lines that structuralize
the background of the print contrast the flowing and billowing lines sculpting the two figures’
robes. The color scheme is not monochromatic but there are very little colors involved,
indicating a simplicity to the print. The simple yet contrasting color scheme, and the clean,
straight, background lines contrasting with the soft lines of the robes create emphasis,
simplicity and serenity within the print.</p>
