  <h1> Himeji Castle <h1>
<img src= "./pics/himeji.jpg" />

<p>Himeji Castle in Hyogo, Japan consists of many sweeping roof structures. Almost all of the roofs are triangular, uniform with grey color, and have pointed tips. There are small rectangular windows balanced throughout to avoid distractions from the elaborate architecture. Intricate wooden details are carved underneath each layer of roof, effortlessly accentuating the beauty of the castle while maintaining a simple ambience. The overlapping angular layout of the rooftops creates an elegant look. The outer walls are painted white which offers a sense of purity and clarity. The stone base supports six stories of roofs to establish dominance and lay a sturdy foundation. There are no surrounding buildings near the castle as it sits alone above the treeline portraying a sense of power in solitude. The many rooftops and their elaborate details combined with the stable stone base creates a dual sense of majesty and security.
