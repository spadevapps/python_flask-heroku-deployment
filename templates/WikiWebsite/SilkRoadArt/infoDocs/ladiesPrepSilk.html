<p>The image of the Inner Shrine of the Ise Grand Shrine represents an architectural form that is geometric, stable, and moderate in size. Its form is made up of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal parallels. Along with the simple structure of the shrine, the medium of work is smooth, unpainted cypress wood. Leaving the cypress wood unpainted allows for a plain and monotone color scheme. The medium of cypress wood, the linear average-sized structure, and the undecorated tone of this shrine comes together to create a sense of simplicity. This display of simplicity alludes to typical Shinto architecture in Japanese culture and reflects the idea of ‘ritual purification’ in the Shinto religion.
