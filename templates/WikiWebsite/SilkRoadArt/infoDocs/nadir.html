<p>Nadir al-Zaman’s painting Jahangir Embracing Shah Abbas portrays the unlikely
embrace between two previous opposed heads of state. Although the painting is fictional
interaction between the two heads of state, this painting illustrates a culturally significant detente
in Asia’s history. The figures’ pose, composition of the background, and the rich color choice
suggest a sentiment of goodwill.
The positioning of the two dominant figures and who they represent contribute to the
aura of peacefulness in the painting. On the right is Jahangir, the Mughal emperor, and to the
right is Shah Abbas of Iran. Although both respected leaders in their own right, al-Zaman
portrays Jahangir as larger in stature and more lavishly dressed than Shah Abbas. This
illustrates how the artist's bias towards one ruler can give present-day viewers of the painting a
warped perception of reality.Therefore, the newfound nonaggression agreement appears to be
an act of Jangir’s benevolence, as Shah Abbas appears grateful for the mercy Jahangir shows
to the Iranian people. Therefore the pose between the two rulers suggests amity, and possibly
even fraternity.
The background imagery suggests the magnitude of detente. The two figures are
positioned on a globe; their feet planted in their respective homeland. Their arms stretch across
the geographic distance, suggesting peace across the land. The globe only depicts Asia,
lending focus on the geographic region. Similarly, the lion and the lamb are shown at the
leaders’ feet. The lion and lamb are frequently symbols of peace,especially in Judeo-Chrsitian
art, because the two are symbolically the mightiest and meekest creatures in the animal
kingdom . Moreover, the choice of the lion at Jahangir's feet suggests the dominance of the
Mughal empire, while the lamb at Shah Abbas’s feet portrays the Iranians as weaker and
inferior. Through the use of animal imagery and the globe, al-Zaman shows depicts his
preference for the Mughal Empire while also portraying the expansiveness of the region now at
peace.
The rich color choice in the painting suggests the joy of the newfound peace. Light blue,
the primary color used in the background, is frequently symbolic of purity and peace. Artists
treasured blue because of the expense of the lapis lazuli used to create the pigment. The gold
halo suggests wealth, royalty, and dignity. Both leaders were remarkably powerful, and the halo
shows that the two leaders valued the new peace. Likewise, both rulers wear vibrant royal robes
to depict their positions of power. This vibrancy suggests the significance of two rulers at peace
with one another. None of the factors would solely be able to convey such a tranquil effect.
Rather, it is through al-Zaman’s combination of figures, animals, and colors that allows a reader
to best comprehend the significance of this even in Asian history.</p>
