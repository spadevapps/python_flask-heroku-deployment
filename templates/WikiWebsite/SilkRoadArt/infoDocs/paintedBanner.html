<p>The following is a funeral banner made for Lady Dai in 160 BCE during the early Han Dynasty.
This banner was a painting made on silk. It was T shaped, and it was around two meters tall.
The background was maroon, and the colors on the banner were a contrast of blues and reds
primarily. There is some geometry with the celestial objects and some symmetry with the
images of dragons along the sides. Because the banner was made of silk, the texture of the
piece would have been smooth. The banner was segmented into three distinct sections, and
the images of the dragons that overlapped between multiple sections illustrated the overall
interconnectedness of the piece. The silk medium, the imagery of dragons and the afterlife, and
the ornate shapes within the banner give the piece an overall feeling of otherworldliness.</p>
