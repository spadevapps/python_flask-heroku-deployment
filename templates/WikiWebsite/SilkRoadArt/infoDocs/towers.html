<p>The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur are a set of twin towers connected by an iconic skybridge. When it was built in 1998, it was the tallest structure in the world standing at 452 meters with 88 floors. It is made of stainless steel and tall glass windows. It’s design is unique and meant to symbolize Islamic beliefs. The Islamic geometric design of two interlocking squares which forms an eight pointed star creates the body of the twin towers. They are supposed to represent the Islamic values of unity within unity, harmony, stability, and rationality. The top of each tower is adorned with a massive sphere referred to as a “pinnacle.” The impressive size and duplexity of the Petronas Towers create a sense of power and unity for Malaysia.
