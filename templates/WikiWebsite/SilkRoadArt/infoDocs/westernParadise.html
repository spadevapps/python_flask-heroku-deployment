<img src= "./pics/westernParadise.jpg" />
<p>The Western Paradise of Amitabha Buddha is a snippet of a detail of a wall painting in
cave 217 in Dunhuang Gansu during the Tang Dynasty. The color scheme is very bright and
colorful. The size and scale of this must be huge considering it is a cave where people will come
in and try to interpret the images. The structure of the painting is uniform and well-organized.
The Amitabha Buddha is near the top center which automatically brings the audience to that
particular spot. The Amitabha Buddha contains many lakshana such as elongated earlobes,
mandorla, ushnisha, and simple robes. Bodhisattvas are also present in the left and right sides of
the painting which are represented through their extravagant clothing and being surrounded by
disciples. Because of its scale and intact beautiful bright colors, this Amitabha Buddha wall
painting was created in a cave in order to preserve it from environmental damage as well as to
demonstrate the Tangâ€™s dynasty fondness of the Amitabha Buddha.</p>
